Text based Hex game.

Want to create the user interface to the Hex game first.
There will be a Game class.
This will draw the board and its stones.
There will be grid coordinates along the board.
The user will be prompted to enter in the coordinate of the position he wishes
to place his next stone.
Invalid coordinates will be refused. Coordinates of positions where there is a stone already will
be refused.

There will be a Board class. Board will be an array of board points with info on if there is a stone at that
point and if so what type.
This class with have a method for placing a stone at some coordinate.
This class will have a method that returns a list of empty places.
THis class will have a method that determines which player has won given a full board.

CliInterface will look like this:
                    A B C D E F G H I
                 1   . . . . . . . . .   1
                  2   . . . . . . . . .   2
                   3   . . . . . . . . .   3
                    4   . . . . V . . . .   4
                     5   . . . V . V . . .   5
                      6   . . . . . . . . .   6
                       7   . . . H . H . . .   7
                        8   . H . . . . . . .   8
                         9   . . . . . . . . .   9
      						 A B C D E F G H I             
Where V = vertical and H = horizontal


There will be a class for the AI player.
AIplayer will have a method that takes a game board object as an argument, generates a next move 
and updates the boards state with that move. 
This will be implemented as being purely random at first as a prototype.
This class will later need a move tree that needs to be calculated.
